 * @header
 *
 * Dispatch is an abstract model for expressing concurrency via simple but
 * powerful API. 
 *
 * At the core, dispatch provides serial FIFO queues to which blocks may be
 * submitted. Blocks submitted to these dispatch queues are invoked on a pool
 * of threads fully managed by the system. No guarantee is made regarding
 * which thread a block will be invoked on; however, it is guaranteed that only
 * one block submitted to the FIFO dispatch queue will be invoked at a time.
 *
 * When multiple queues have blocks to be processed, the system is free to
 * allocate additional threads to invoke the blocks concurrently. When the
 * queues become empty, these threads are automatically released.
 */

/*!
 * @typedef dispatch_queue_t
 *
 * @abstract
 * Dispatch queues invoke blocks submitted to them serially in FIFO order. A
 * queue will only invoke one block at a time, but independent queues may each
 * invoke their blocks concurrently with respect to each other.
 *
 * @discussion
 * Dispatch queues are lightweight objects to which blocks may be submitted.
 * The system manages a pool of threads which process dispatch queues and
 * invoke blocks submitted to them.
 *
 * Conceptually a dispatch queue may have its own thread of execution, and
 * interaction between queues is highly asynchronous.
 *
 * Dispatch queues are reference counted via calls to dispatch_retain() and
 * dispatch_release(). Pending blocks submitted to a queue also hold a
 * reference to the queue until they have finished. Once all references to a
 * queue have been released, the queue will be deallocated by the system.

/*!
 * @typedef dispatch_block_t
 *
 * @abstract
 * The prototype of blocks submitted to dispatch queues, which take no
 * arguments and have no return value.
 *
 * @discussion
 * The declaration of a block allocates storage on the stack. Therefore, this
 * is an invalid construct:
 *
 * dispatch_block_t block;
 *
 * if (x) {
 *     block = ^{ printf("true\n"); };
 * } else {
 *     block = ^{ printf("false\n"); };
 * }
 * block(); // unsafe!!!
 *
 * What is happening behind the scenes:
 *
 * if (x) {
 *     struct Block __tmp_1 = ...; // setup details
 *     block = &__tmp_1;
 * } else {
 *     struct Block __tmp_2 = ...; // setup details
 *     block = &__tmp_2;
 * }
 *
 * As the example demonstrates, the address of a stack variable is escaping the
 * scope in which it is allocated. That is a classic C bug.
